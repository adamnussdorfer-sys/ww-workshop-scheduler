# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Coordinators can see the full weekly workshop schedule at a glance, spot conflicts immediately, and publish changes with confidence.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Interactive Polish — Phase 5: Context Foundation + Toast System

## Current Position

Phase: 5 (Context Foundation + Toast System)
Plan: 1 of 1 complete
Status: Phase 5 execution in progress — Plan 01 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Phase 5 Plan 01 complete (sonner toast system + AppContext filters/memoization)

```
Progress: [###-----------------] 1/7 phases (Phase 5 Plan 01 done)
```

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
All v1.0 decisions have been reviewed and marked with outcomes.

**v1.1 architectural decisions (from research):**
- Filter state lives in AppContext (not Sidebar or page-level) — Sidebar is a writer, pages are readers
- Toast via context + single ToastStack in App.jsx above router — prevents duplicate stacks
- Centralized useKeyboardShortcuts hook with ref pattern — prevents listener leaks and Esc conflicts
- filterEngine.js as pure utility — reusable across CalendarGrid, CoachRoster, DraftManager without coupling
- DraftManager reads workshops from useApp() + useMemo — never local state copy (prevents stale data)

**Phase 5 Plan 01 decisions:**
- Import toast directly from sonner in WorkshopForm (not via context threading) — idiomatic, avoids prop drilling
- Toaster placed as sibling before AppShell inside AppContext.Provider (outside Routes) — critical for navigation survival
- Plain toast() calls (not toast.success/error) — WW brand blue/coral does not match sonner richColors green/red
- setCoaches/setWorkshops/setFilters omitted from useMemo deps — React guarantees setState identity stability
- toast re-exported on context value — allows useApp() import path, zero behavioral cost

### Pending Todos

- Verify coach availability data shape in coaches.js before Phase 10 (OVER-01/OVER-02 depend on availability[].day/start/end fields)
- Verify workshops.js includes status: "draft" | "published" field before Phase 9 (DRAF-01 through DRAF-05)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
